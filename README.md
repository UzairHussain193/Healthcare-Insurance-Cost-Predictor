# Healthcare Insurance Cost Predictor

This project aims to predict healthcare insurance costs using regression techniques. The dataset contains various features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region, which are used to predict the insurance charges.

Healthcare costs can vary significantly based on various factors. This project uses machine learning regression models to predict the insurance costs based on the provided features.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [GitHub Repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/Regression-Example/refs/heads/master/insurance.csv). It includes the following columns: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges.

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The project uses various regression models to predict insurance costs, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. The results are visualized using plots to compare the predicted values against the actual values.
